# Neural Machine Translation using PyTorch

This repository contains code snippets for a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system implemented using PyTorch. NMT is a deep learning approach to machine translation that has gained significant popularity for its ability to generate high-quality translations between languages.

## Overview

The code snippets are organized into different sections, each representing a specific part of the NMT system. Here's a brief overview of what each section does:

### Data Preprocessing

The initial code snippets focus on data preprocessing. They include functions to normalize and prepare text data, create vocabularies, and encode the data for training.

### Dataset and DataLoader

We define a custom dataset and a data loader using PyTorch's DataLoader class. This is crucial for efficiently feeding data to the model during training.

### Encoder and Decoder

The core components of the NMT system are the encoder and decoder. These code snippets implement both components as PyTorch neural networks. The encoder processes the source language input, while the decoder generates the target language output.

### Training

The training section includes code for training the NMT model. It covers loss computation, backpropagation, and optimization using SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent).

### Translation

We provide a translation function that takes an input sequence in the source language and generates the corresponding translation in the target language. This function uses the trained encoder and decoder models.
